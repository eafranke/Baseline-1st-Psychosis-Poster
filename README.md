# What happened to patients with a 1st hospitalization for a psychosis at Cambridge Health Alliance (1/1/2019â€“12/31/2020)

## About

This repository contains documentation and analysis for a research project examining inpatient treatment and disposition for First Episode Psychosis (FEP) patients at Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA). The study focuses on racial and ethnic disparities in treatment, changes during the COVID-19 pandemic, and follow-up care with Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) clinics. This work was conducted in collaboration with Harvard Medical School faculty and funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and McLean Hospital.

## Research Objectives

- Assess treatment and follow-up outcomes for FEP patients from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds.
- Determine whether inpatient units adequately referred patients to CSC clinics.
- Examine how treatment patterns shifted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Hypotheses

1. Treatment and disposition outcomes differ by race and ethnicity.  
2. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted treatment patterns and follow-up care.
